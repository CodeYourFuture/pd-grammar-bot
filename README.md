# PD Grammar Bot

## What is this?
Checking for grammar, spelling and punctuation mistakes in PD coursework before submitting is very important. Trainees are not using extensions in word processing software to do this and volunteers are having to check manually which takes up a lot of their time. The PD Grammar Bot is a GitHub app which automatically checks PD coursework submissions for mistakes:
- After forking a CYF repo containing PD coursework issues, the user installs the app in the forked repo through a link.
- The coursework is submitted as a PDF file on the issue page, downloaded from Google Docs.
- The app sends the file to LanguageTool to check for mistakes and the user can repeat this process till there are no more mistakes.
